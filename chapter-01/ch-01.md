# Shell Something Out
## Displaying output in a terminal
The shell supports several methods and different formats for displaying text. A shell script typically begins with a shebang:`#!/bin/bash`.
### executing a script containing shebang
1. `bash myScript.sh`
2. Set the execution permission : `chmod 755 myScript.sh` and then `./myScript.sh`.
3. Alternatively, `chmod a+x sample.sh` makes a script executable by all users.
### Types of bash
1. *logging bash*: when using SSH or logging directly to terminal. will read `.bash_profile`.
2. *Terminal*: when you logged in and open a terminal. It will read `~/.bashrc`.
### printing in Terminal: `echo`
- `echo "character"` or `echo '<character>'` adds a new line at the end of every invocation.
- `""`: takes special characters and variable expansion. Escape special characters with `\`.
- `''`: does not support special characters and expansion.
- `echo -n "string"`: disable the new line
- `echo -e "1\t2\t3"`: e flag  enables interpretation of backslash escape `\`. here `\t` interpret to `tab`.
### printing using `printf`
- printf does not append a newline.
- We have to specify a newline when required
- The `%s, %c, %d, and %f` characters are *format substitution characters*
- The `%-5s` string defines a string substitution with left alignment (- represents left alignment) and a 5 character width. If - was not specified, the string would have been aligned to the right.
- The width specifies the number of characters reserved for the string.
- in the following example, For `Name`, the width reserved is 10. Hence, any name will reside within the 10-character width reserved for it and the rest of the line will be filled with spaces up to 10 characters total.
- `%-4.2f`:width is 4, and .2 specifies rounding off to two decimal places

```
#!/bin/bash
#Filename: printf.sh

printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4s\n" No Name  Mark
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 1 Sarath 80.3456
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 2 James 90.9989
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 3 Jeff 77.564
```
the formatted output is:

```
No    Name       Mark
1     Sarath     80.35
2     James      91.00
3     Jeff       77.56
